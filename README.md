# The-Training-Pad
This is my training pad, where I have coded and tested many problems and challenges on my free time or for interview preparation.
It consists of solutions to many questions I've been solving from different sources, along with implementation of different data structures for re-using in different problems.
Also, contains few of the Design Questions that I found interesting to code.
