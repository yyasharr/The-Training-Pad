# The-Training-Pad
This is my training pad, where I have coded and tested many problems and challenges on my free time or for interview preparation.
It consists of solutions to many questions I've been solving from different sources, along with implementation of different data structures for re-using in different problems.
Also, contains few of the Design Questions that I found interesting to code.
### Data Structures
Trees , LinkedLists, Tries, Min/Max Heap and Doubly LinkedLists along with many useful methods for each and sample initializers for testing purposes.
### Helper Methods
Printing with over loading of many Iterator collections, Sort methods (Quick, Merge and Heap Sorts), Different iterators for traversing data structures (DFS/BFS, Iterative/Recursive, etc.)
### Design Problems
Such as cache algorithms (LRU/LFU cache), Log system, Median Finder, Etc. In many cases, used my pre-built data structures to code the algorithm.
### Interview Questions
In **Questions from Sources** folder, there are more than 3000 (and counting) lines code, mostly interview preparation questions that I have solved and coded from different sources, online or hard copy books.
